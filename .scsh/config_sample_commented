# The goal here is to With be able to use the same host alias to connect
# regardless of whether the user is was local or remote, like how it works in
# ssh, and allow a user on MacOS to connect to VNC via the command line.
#
# In this example, if we find a match on original host, we're checking the
# current wi-fi SSID and comparing it to a known value - "Home's Wifi SSID". If
# the values match (and therefore we're on the same network as our
# destination), we use the configuration settings in the Match block. Because
# the Match block is the first block in this config, it has the highest
# priority when it comes to setting values (if it finds a match).
#
# Beacuse the Host block is second, it will only set configuration values if
# the Match block above it fails to - specifically for homeserver, HomeServer,
# and homeServer, as those are in the list for the Match block above it too. In
# the case of those hostnames, the Host block will only match if the wi-fi SSID
# doesn't match the known value, in the exec part of the Match block above it.
#
# Please note the remote-specific host entries - the ones ending in -remote,
# in the Host block. These will allow a user to initiate a remote connection
# even if they're on their home network. This is useful in my setup at least,
# because when I'm home I connect over .local and when I'm remote I connect via
# my DDNS provider. Additionally, note how the port for remote connections is
# set differently from the default, to account for port forwarding.
#
# Finally, if no match is made, the tool will attempt to initiate a connection
# directly to whatever string was passed into it (parsed into username,
# hostname and port),

Match originalhost 'homeserver,HomeServer,homeServer' exec "[[ $(ipconfig getsummary en0 | awk -F ' SSID : ' '/ SSID : / {print $2}') == 'Home'\''s WiFi SSID' ]]"
